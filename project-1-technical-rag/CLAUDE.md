**Component Interface Standardization**: Successfully implemented across all components
**Platform Service Integration**: All components now use platform services
**Performance Impact**: <5% overhead maintained (within target)
**Architecture Compliance**: 100% - all components implement ComponentBase interface
**Quality Standards**: Swiss engineering standards maintained throughout

## Role Focus: Phase 3 Ready - Advanced System Integration
**Perspective**: Production-ready system integration with comprehensive testing
**Key Concerns**: End-to-end workflows, performance optimization, production deployment
**Decision Framework**: System integration, comprehensive testing, production readiness
**Output Style**: Complete system integration, performance optimization, deployment preparation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL SAFEGUARDS ⚠️
**MANDATORY**: Consult `.claude/ARCHITECTURE_SAFEGUARDS.md` before ANY implementation
**MANDATORY**: All components must implement STANDARD INTERFACES
**MANDATORY**: Components must USE platform services, not implement them
**MANDATORY**: NO component-specific service implementations

## Implementation Target: Advanced System Integration (Phase 3)
### Current Phase: Phase 3 of 3-phase refactoring
### Focus: End-to-end system integration and production readiness

## Key Files for Implementation:
- `/src/components/retrievers/advanced_retriever.py` - Source code to extract
- `/src/components/query_processors/modular_query_processor.py` - Target implementation
- `/src/core/interfaces.py` - Interface definitions
- `/config/advanced_test.yaml` - Configuration management
- `/tests/` - Comprehensive test validation

## Implementation Strategy:

### Step 1: Extract Query Analytics Collection
- Create `QueryAnalytics` sub-component in Query Processor
- Implement analytics collection interfaces
- Add query performance tracking
- Test analytics accuracy and reporting

### Step 2: Extract Workflow Orchestration Logic
- Create `WorkflowOrchestrator` sub-component in Query Processor
- Implement workflow decision making
- Add pipeline coordination
- Test workflow orchestration functionality

### Step 3: Extract A/B Testing Framework
- Create `ExperimentManager` sub-component in Query Processor
- Implement experiment configuration
- Add assignment and analysis methods
- Test A/B testing functionality

### Step 4: Integrate with Existing Query Processor
- Update `ModularQueryProcessor` to include new sub-components
- Implement proper workflow orchestration
- Add configuration management
- Test complete query processing pipeline

### Step 5: Remove Workflow Logic from AdvancedRetriever
- Remove query analytics from retriever
- Remove workflow orchestration logic
- Remove A/B testing framework
- Test retriever with clean boundaries

## Swiss Engineering Implementation Standards:
### Code Quality: Comprehensive error handling, proper logging, Swiss documentation
### Testing: Unit tests for each extracted component, integration tests
### Performance: Maintain Apple Silicon optimization, <5% performance overhead
### Backward Compatibility: Maintain existing query processing interface
### Architecture Compliance: Clean component boundaries, proper interfaces

## Query Processor Sub-component Architecture:
### Existing Sub-components:
