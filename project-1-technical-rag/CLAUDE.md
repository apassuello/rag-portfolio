## Planning and Documentation Guidelines

- When creating a plan, ALWAYS add at the beginning the documents/files you read and actions you executed to gather the context to make this plan. Also ALWAYS write a copy of it to a file for completion follow-up and context restoration when starting a new conversation

- Always document the location of important progress notes and memory files to easily read back and restore context in new conversations

- Since plans can be long and complex, write the plan to a file and use the file to document:
  - Completion progress
  - Gained insights
  - How to re-gather the appropriate context for continuing work
