# 🔧 Production Fixes Applied - HuggingFace Spaces Deployment

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: White Text on White Background ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Answer and source text displayed as white text on white background, making content invisible.

**Root Cause**: CSS styling for `.answer-box` and `.citation-box` classes didn't specify text color, causing inheritance from theme defaults.

**Solution Applied**:
```css
.answer-box {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    border: 1px solid #dee2e6;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 1.5rem;
    margin: 1rem 0;
    color: #212529;  /* ← ADDED: Explicit dark text color */
}

.citation-box {
    background-color: #e8f4f8;
    border-left: 4px solid #1f77b4;
    padding: 1rem;
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    color: #212529;  /* ← ADDED: Explicit dark text color */
}
```

**Files Modified**: `streamlit_app.py` (lines 67, 59)

### Issue 2: Sources Showing for Unrelated Queries ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: System showed citations even when LLM correctly rejected unrelated questions (e.g., non-RISC-V topics).

**Root Cause**: Two-fold issue:
1. **Retrieval Level**: FAISS and BM25 always return "top_k" results regardless of relevance
2. **Display Level**: UI showed citations even for rejection responses

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Retrieval-Level Filtering (Primary Fix)
Added similarity threshold filtering to prevent irrelevant chunks from being retrieved:

**Basic Query (`basic_rag.py`)**:
```python
def query(self, question: str, top_k: int = 5, similarity_threshold: float = 0.3) -> Dict:
    # Filter results by similarity threshold
    for score, idx in zip(scores[0], indices[0]):
        if idx < len(self.chunks) and float(score) >= similarity_threshold:
            # Only include chunks above threshold
```

**Hybrid Query (`hybrid_search.py`)**:
```python
def search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 10, similarity_threshold: float = 0.3):
    # Apply similarity filtering in dense search
    results = [
        (int(indices[0][i]), float(similarities[0][i]))
        for i in range(len(indices[0]))
        if indices[0][i] != -1 and float(similarities[0][i]) >= similarity_threshold
    ]
```

#### 2. Smart Display Logic (Secondary Fix)
Enhanced UI to detect rejection responses and hide irrelevant citations:

**Detection Logic (`streamlit_app.py`)**:
```python
# Detect rejection/out-of-scope answers
is_rejection = any(phrase in answer_text for phrase in [
    "not available in the context",
    "cannot answer",
    "not found in the documentation",
    "outside the scope",
    # ... more patterns
])

# Only show citations for valid answers
if result["citations"] and not is_rejection:
    st.markdown("### 📚 Sources")
    # Display citations
elif is_rejection:
    st.info("💡 **Tip**: This question appears to be outside the scope...")
```

#### 3. User Control
Added similarity threshold slider to UI for user adjustment:

```python
similarity_threshold = st.slider(
    "Similarity Threshold",
    0.0, 1.0, 0.3, 0.05,
    help="Minimum similarity to include results (higher = more strict)"
)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/basic_rag.py` - Added similarity filtering to query methods
- `src/shared_utils/retrieval/hybrid_search.py` - Added threshold to dense search
- `src/rag_with_generation.py` - Propagated threshold parameter through call chain
- `streamlit_app.py` - Added smart citation display and user controls

## 🧪 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ Text Visibility
- **Answer text**: Clear, dark text on light background
- **Citation text**: Clear, dark text on colored background
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on all Streamlit themes

### ✅ Smart Citation Handling

**For RISC-V Related Questions** (e.g., "What is RISC-V?"):
- ✅ Retrieves relevant chunks (similarity > 0.3)
- ✅ Shows comprehensive answer with citations
- ✅ Displays sources section with page references

**For Unrelated Questions** (e.g., "What is the weather?"):
- ✅ No chunks retrieved (all below similarity threshold)
- ✅ Returns: "I couldn't find relevant information in the documentation to answer your question."
- ✅ Shows "Status: Out of scope" instead of source count
- ✅ Displays helpful tip instead of citations

### ✅ User Control
- **Similarity Threshold Slider**: 0.0 to 1.0 (default: 0.3)
- **Higher values**: More strict filtering, fewer irrelevant results
- **Lower values**: More permissive, may include marginally relevant content

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Update HuggingFace Space
1. **Upload modified files** to your HuggingFace Space
2. **Keep existing environment variables**:
   ```
   USE_INFERENCE_PROVIDERS=true
   HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. **Deploy** and monitor startup logs

### Step 2: Validation Tests

**Test 1: Text Visibility**
- Upload any PDF and ask a question
- ✅ Verify answer text is clearly visible
- ✅ Verify citation text is clearly visible

**Test 2: Relevant Query**
- Ask: "What is RISC-V?"
- ✅ Should show answer with citations
- ✅ Should show "Sources: X" metric
- ✅ Should display sources section

**Test 3: Unrelated Query** 
- Ask: "What is the weather today?"
- ✅ Should show rejection message
- ✅ Should show "Status: Out of scope" metric
- ✅ Should display tip instead of citations

**Test 4: Threshold Control**
- Set similarity threshold to 0.8 (very strict)
- Ask a borderline question
- ✅ Should return fewer or no results
- Set threshold to 0.1 (permissive)
- ✅ Should return more results
