# AdvancedRetriever Refactoring Session Plan

## Executive Summary
The AdvancedRetriever contains **8 major architectural violations** that violate the 6-component architecture. This plan outlines 3 focused sessions to restore architectural compliance while maintaining all Epic 2 features.

## Architecture Violation Summary
- **Current Architecture Compliance**: 40%
- **Target Architecture Compliance**: 100%
- **Violations**: 8 categories, 23 specific features
- **Refactoring Priority**: HIGH (Critical violations)

## 3-Session Refactoring Strategy (CORRECTED)

### SESSION 1: Platform Orchestrator System Services (ARCHITECT → IMPLEMENTER)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Focus**: Universal system services creation
**Context Template**: `IMPLEMENTER_MODE_PLATFORM_ORCHESTRATOR_MIGRATION.md`

#### Pre-Session Setup:
```bash
# Load context template
cp .claude/context-templates/IMPLEMENTER_MODE_PLATFORM_ORCHESTRATOR_MIGRATION.md .claude/claude.md

# Validate system baseline
python tests/comprehensive_integration_test.py
python tests/integration_validation/validate_architecture_compliance.py
```

#### Session Objectives:
- [ ] **ComponentHealthService** → Universal health monitoring for ALL components
- [ ] **SystemAnalyticsService** → Universal analytics collection for ALL components
- [ ] **ABTestingService** → Universal A/B testing for ALL components
- [ ] **ConfigurationService** → Universal configuration management for ALL components
- [ ] **BackendManagementService** → Universal backend management for ALL components

#### Success Criteria:
- Platform Orchestrator provides system-wide services that ALL components can use
- Services are universal and not component-specific
- All services follow standard interface patterns
- <5% performance overhead from service architecture

#### Session End Protocol:
1. Run comprehensive tests to validate functionality
2. Measure performance impact of migration
3. Document migration success and any issues
4. Prepare handoff for Session 2

### SESSION 2: Component Interface Standardization (ARCHITECT → IMPLEMENTER)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Focus**: Standard interfaces in ALL components
**Context Template**: `IMPLEMENTER_MODE_QUERY_PROCESSOR_MIGRATION.md`

#### Pre-Session Setup:
```bash
# Load context template
cp .claude/context-templates/IMPLEMENTER_MODE_QUERY_PROCESSOR_MIGRATION.md .claude/claude.md

# Validate Session 1 results
python tests/comprehensive_integration_test.py
python tests/integration_validation/validate_architecture_compliance.py
```

#### Session Objectives:
- [ ] **Component Base Interface** → Universal interface for all components
- [ ] **AdvancedRetriever Interface** → Convert to use platform services
- [ ] **All Components Interface** → Implement standard interfaces in ALL components
- [ ] **Platform Service Integration** → Enable all components to use platform services

#### Success Criteria:
- All components implement standard interfaces (get_health_status, get_metrics, get_capabilities)
- All components use platform services instead of implementing their own
- Cross-component feature applicability achieved
- <5% performance overhead from interface standardization

#### Session End Protocol:
1. Run comprehensive tests to validate functionality
2. Measure performance impact of migration
3. Document migration success and any issues
4. Prepare handoff for Session 3

### SESSION 3: Query Processor Workflow Enhancement (ARCHITECT → IMPLEMENTER)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Focus**: Query workflow orchestration with platform services
**Context Template**: `IMPLEMENTER_MODE_COMPONENT_CLEANUP.md`

#### Pre-Session Setup:
```bash
# Load context template
cp .claude/context-templates/IMPLEMENTER_MODE_COMPONENT_CLEANUP.md .claude/claude.md

# Validate Session 2 results
python tests/comprehensive_integration_test.py
python tests/integration_validation/validate_architecture_compliance.py
```

#### Session Objectives:
- [ ] **Query Analysis and Optimization** → Enhanced QueryAnalyzer with Epic 2 features
- [ ] **Workflow Orchestration** → Enhanced WorkflowOrchestrator using platform services
- [ ] **Response Assembly** → Enhanced ResponseAssembler with Epic 2 integration
- [ ] **Component Feature Placement** → Move remaining features to proper components

#### Success Criteria:
- Query Processor orchestrates workflow using platform services
- Epic 2 features properly integrated through workflow orchestration
- 100% component boundary compliance
- <5% performance overhead from workflow enhancement

#### Session End Protocol:
1. Run comprehensive tests to validate functionality
2. Measure complete system performance
3. Validate 100% architecture compliance
4. Document complete refactoring success

## Session Handoff Protocol

### Between Sessions:
1. **Performance Baseline**: Capture before/after metrics
2. **Architecture Compliance**: Validate component boundaries
3. **Functionality Validation**: Run comprehensive tests
4. **Issue Documentation**: Record any problems or concerns

### Session Reports:
Each session should generate a comprehensive report including:
- Features successfully migrated
- Performance impact measurements
- Architecture compliance improvements
- Issues encountered and resolved
- Next session preparation instructions

## Quality Gates (Swiss Engineering Standards)

### Architecture Compliance:
- **Session 1**: 60% compliance (system-wide concerns isolated)
- **Session 2**: 80% compliance (workflow orchestration isolated)
- **Session 3**: 100% compliance (all boundaries clean)

### Performance Standards:
- **Each Session**: <5% performance overhead
- **Complete Migration**: <10% total performance impact
- **Apple Silicon**: Maintain MPS optimization

### Testing Standards:
- **Unit Tests**: >95% coverage for migrated components
- **Integration Tests**: All component interactions validated
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete system functionality preserved

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Backup Strategy:
- Create git branch before each session
- Maintain working system state at all times
- Have rollback plan for each migration

### Functionality Preservation:
- Test all Epic 2 features after each session
- Validate backward compatibility
- Ensure no regression in answer quality

### Performance Monitoring:
- Measure performance impact of each migration
- Monitor memory usage and optimization
- Validate Apple Silicon efficiency maintained

## Expected Outcomes

### Final Architecture State:
- **Platform Orchestrator**: System health, backend management, configuration
- **Document Processor**: Graph enhancement, document migration
- **Embedder**: Embedding configuration and optimization
- **Retriever**: Document retrieval and ranking ONLY
- **Answer Generator**: Neural reranking and answer generation
- **Query Processor**: Workflow orchestration and analytics

### Swiss Engineering Benefits:
- **Maintainability**: 250% → 120% complexity reduction
- **Testability**: 300% → 110% complexity reduction
- **Architecture Compliance**: 40% → 100% compliance
- **Performance**: <10% overhead for clean architecture

## Next Steps After Refactoring

1. **Epic 2 Demo Validation**: Ensure all Epic 2 features work correctly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Apply embedded systems optimizations
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suite validation
4. **Documentation Update**: Update architecture documentation
5. **Portfolio Preparation**: Swiss tech market readiness assessment
