# Platform Orchestrator Service File Organization - Initial Prompt

## Session Objective
**Refactor Platform Orchestrator service implementations to proper file organization following Swiss engineering standards and established modular patterns.**

## Background Context
In Session 1 of the AdvancedRetriever refactoring, 5 universal system services were successfully implemented and tested:
- ComponentHealthService ✅
- SystemAnalyticsService ✅  
- ABTestingService ✅
- ConfigurationService ✅
- BackendManagementService ✅

**Issue Identified**: While the architectural separation was correct, all service implementations were embedded directly in `platform_orchestrator.py`, creating a massive file that violates Swiss engineering file organization standards.

## Current Problem
```python
# platform_orchestrator.py (currently ~2600+ lines)
class ComponentHealthServiceImpl:     # 200+ lines
class SystemAnalyticsServiceImpl:    # 300+ lines  
class ABTestingServiceImpl:          # 250+ lines
class ConfigurationServiceImpl:      # 200+ lines
class BackendManagementServiceImpl:  # 400+ lines
class PlatformOrchestrator:          # 500+ lines
```

## Target Solution
```
src/core/
├─ platform_orchestrator.py (clean, ~300 lines)
├─ interfaces.py (existing interfaces)
└─ services/
   ├─ __init__.py
   ├─ component_health_service.py
   ├─ system_analytics_service.py
   ├─ ab_testing_service.py
   ├─ configuration_service.py
   └─ backend_management_service.py
```

## Success Criteria
1. **Clean File Organization**: Each service in its own file following project patterns
2. **Zero Functionality Loss**: All existing service functionality preserved exactly
3. **Zero Performance Impact**: No performance degradation from refactoring
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing tests pass without modification
5. **Clean Imports**: Proper `__init__.py` with organized exports
6. **Swiss Engineering Standards**: Maintainable, organized codebase

## Architectural Requirements
- **Follow Established Patterns**: Use same modular organization as Document Processor, Embedder, Retriever
- **Preserve Interfaces**: All service interfaces in `interfaces.py` remain unchanged
- **Clean Platform Orchestrator**: Reduce to service coordination and dependency injection only
- **Maintain Performance**: All services must retain their performance characteristics

## Validation Required
- All 5 services function identically after extraction
- Platform Orchestrator initialization works unchanged
- All existing service tests pass without modification
- Performance measurements show no degradation
- Import structure resolves correctly

## Initial Task
Please start the session by:

1. **Reading the Context**: Load the service file organization context template from `.claude/context-templates/IMPLEMENTER_MODE_SERVICE_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md`

2. **Analyzing Current State**: Examine the current `platform_orchestrator.py` to understand the service implementations that need extraction

3. **Planning the Refactoring**: Understand the target file organization and validate the approach against existing modular patterns

4. **Beginning Implementation**: Start with creating the services directory structure and extracting the first service

The goal is to achieve clean, maintainable file organization while preserving all the excellent architectural work completed in Session 1.

## Context Template to Use
`.claude/context-templates/IMPLEMENTER_MODE_SERVICE_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md`

## Key Insight
This refactoring addresses the valid concern about file organization while preserving the architectural success of the service-based design. The services themselves are architected correctly - they just need proper file separation for maintainability.
