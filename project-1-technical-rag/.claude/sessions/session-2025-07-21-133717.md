# Session Record: Enhanced Retriever Logging & AMO Query Fix
**Date**: July 21, 2025 - 13:37:17  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Enhanced retrieval logging and zero-results query fix  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Git-Verified Work

### Files Changed (git diff verification)
- **config/epic2.yaml**: Major fusion strategy configuration changes
- **src/components/retrievers/fusion/score_aware_fusion.py**: Enhanced logging implementation
- **run_enhanced_streamlit_demo.py**: Updated logger configuration (new file)
- **src/components/retrievers/modular_unified_retriever.py**: Added detailed retrieval logging

### Key Code Changes
1. **Fusion Strategy Switch**: Changed from GraphEnhancedRRFFusion to ScoreAwareFusion
   ```yaml
   # Before: RRF-based fusion with low score preservation
   type: "graph_enhanced_rrf"
   
   # After: Score-aware fusion with 80%+ preservation
   type: "score_aware"
   config:
     score_weight: 0.8      # High importance on preserving original scores
     rank_weight: 0.2       # Moderate rank stability
     overlap_weight: 0.1    # Bonus for dual-retriever matches
   ```

2. **Semantic Alignment Threshold**: Reduced from 0.3 to 0.2 for better technical query recall

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive retrieval process logging with score tracking

## Test-Verified Accomplishments

### Core Fix Validated
- **AMO Query**: "What are AMOs?" now returns relevant results (verified by user)
- **Score Preservation**: 82.1% preservation of BM25 perfect matches (vs 3.9% before)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Complete visibility into retrieval process with document scores

### Performance Metrics (from test logs)
```
INPUT SPARSE TOP: [185] ‚Üí 1.0000 (perfect BM25 match)
TOP FUSED: [185] ‚Üí 0.8212
SCORE PRESERVATION: 82.1% of max input score
FUSION WEIGHTS: score=0.73, rank=0.18, overlap=0.09
FINAL RETRIEVAL RESULTS: 5 documents (was 0 before)
```

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Root Cause Analysis Success
- **Issue Identified**: GraphEnhancedRRFFusion was reducing BM25 perfect matches (1.0000) to very low fusion scores (0.0391)
- **Secondary Issue**: Semantic alignment threshold (0.3) was rejecting technically relevant results (0.221 alignment)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provided complete visibility into each retrieval stage with document scores

### 2. Multi-Layer Solution Implementation
- **Primary Fix**: Switched to ScoreAwareFusion to preserve strong BM25 scores
- **Secondary Fix**: Reduced semantic alignment threshold from 0.3 to 0.2
- **Tertiary Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging to all retrieval components

### 3. Enhanced Debugging Capabilities
- **Detailed Retrieval Logging**: Shows dense search, sparse search, fusion, and reranking stages
- **Score Preservation Metrics**: Tracks how fusion affects original retrieval scores  
- **Component Visibility**: Logs fusion strategy, reranker type, and processing times
- **Performance Tracking**: Shows retrieval time, document counts, and success rates

## Technical Decisions

### Fusion Strategy Selection
**Decision**: Switch from GraphEnhancedRRFFusion to ScoreAwareFusion
**Rationale**: 
- RRF produces rank-based scores that don't preserve BM25 perfect matches
- Score-aware fusion maintains semantic relevance while adding stability
- 82.1% score preservation vs 3.9% is dramatically better for keyword queries

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- Lost graph enhancement features (entity extraction, document relationships)
- Gained better keyword query performance and score transparency
- Maintained neural reranking and other Epic 2 features

### Threshold Adjustment
**Decision**: Reduce semantic alignment threshold from 0.3 to 0.2
**Rationale**: Technical terminology queries often have lower semantic alignment due to domain-specific language
**Impact**: Allows relevant technical results to pass alignment checks

### Logging Enhancement Strategy
**Decision**: Add comprehensive logging throughout retrieval pipeline
**Rationale**: 
- Provides debugging visibility for complex retrieval decisions
- Shows score preservation effectiveness for different fusion strategies
- Enables performance analysis and optimization

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. Zero Retrieval Results
**Problem**: "What are AMOs?" returned 0 documents despite finding relevant matches
**Root Cause**: RRF fusion drastically reduced BM25 perfect matches, then semantic alignment rejected them
**Solution**: Score-aware fusion preserves strong BM25 scores, allowing semantic alignment to pass

### 2. Lack of Retrieval Debugging Visibility  
**Problem**: No insight into why queries succeeded or failed at different stages
**Solution**: Added detailed logging showing:
- Dense and sparse search results with scores
- Fusion input/output score comparison
- Score preservation ratios
- Final ranking with document titles

### 3. Configuration Testing Complexity
**Problem**: Testing fusion strategy changes required full system reload
**Solution**: Added backup configuration comments for easy strategy switching

## Validation Results

### Enhanced Logging Verification
```log
üîç MODULAR RETRIEVER: Starting retrieval for query: 'What are AMOs?' (k=5)
üéØ DENSE SEARCH: Searching for top 10 candidates
üìä TOP SPARSE SCORES: [185] doc_185... ‚Üí 1.0000
üîÑ FUSION STRATEGY: Using ScoreAwareFusion to combine results
üìä SCORE PRESERVATION RESULTS:
   üìà TOP FUSED: [185] ‚Üí 0.8212
   üîÑ SCORE PRESERVATION: 82.1% of max input score
üéØ FINAL RETRIEVAL RESULTS: 5 documents
```

### Query Success Metrics
- **Before**: 0 documents returned for technical queries
- **After**: 5 relevant documents with proper AMO content
- **Score Quality**: Maintains high confidence scores (69.2%)
