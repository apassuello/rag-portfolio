## Development Philosophy

### Epic 2 Design Patterns
- **Modular Architecture**: Maintain clear separation of concerns
- **Configuration-driven**: All features configurable via YAML
- **Performance-first**: Meet latency targets while adding sophistication
- **Quality Enhancement**: Measurable improvements in answer relevance

### Implementation Guidelines
- Follow established Epic 2 component patterns
- Use adapter pattern for external models (cross-encoder)
- Implement direct algorithms for score fusion and query detection
- Ensure graceful degradation when neural reranking unavailable

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Cross-encoder neural reranking operational
- [ ] Adaptive reranking strategies for different query types
- [ ] >20% improvement in answer relevance validated
- [ ] Performance targets met (<700ms P95 with neural processing)
- [ ] Complete integration with AdvancedRetriever configuration

## Next Session Preparation

### Week 4 Focus
After completing neural reranking, Week 4 will focus on:
- **Graph Integration**: Connect Week 2 graph components to AdvancedRetriever
- **A/B Testing**: Implement experiment framework for feature comparison
- **Final Optimization**: System-wide performance tuning and portfolio score recovery
- **Production Readiness**: Complete Epic 2 with all features operational

### Portfolio Score Recovery
Expected progression:
- **Week 3 Start**: 74.6% (neural reranking configured but not implemented)
- **Week 3 End**: ~80-85% (neural reranking operational, quality improvements)
- **Week 4 End**: 90-95% (graph integration complete, all features operational)

## Get Started

**Your first task**: Begin implementing the neural reranking module following the Phase 1 plan. Start by creating the module structure and implementing the basic CrossEncoderReranker with cross-encoder model integration.

Focus on leveraging the large performance headroom (31ms → 700ms target) to implement sophisticated neural reranking while maintaining excellent system performance.

**Remember**: The AdvancedRetriever framework is already operational and ready for neural reranking integration. Build on the solid foundation from Weeks 1-2 to add this crucial quality enhancement capability.
