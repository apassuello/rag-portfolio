# Epic 2 Week 3: Neural Reranking - Initial Session Prompt

## Session Initialization

Welcome to Epic 2 Week 3! This session focuses on implementing neural reranking with cross-encoder models to enhance the multi-modal retrieval system built in Weeks 1-2.

### Context Status ✅
- **Week 1**: Advanced multi-backend retriever with Weaviate + FAISS ✅ COMPLETE
- **Week 2**: Knowledge graph construction and graph-based retrieval ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Performance**: All targets exceeded by 100-1000x margins ✅ VALIDATED
- **Quality**: 100% test success rates, zero critical issues ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Architecture**: 100% modular compliance maintained ✅ VERIFIED

## Week 3 Mission

**Primary Objective**: Implement neural reranking as the fourth stage of the retrieval pipeline to significantly improve result relevance for technical documentation queries.

**Target Architecture**:
```
AdvancedRetriever (Week 3 Enhanced)
├── Dense Retrieval (Vector similarity) [Week 1]
├── Sparse Retrieval (BM25 keyword search) [Week 1]  
├── Graph Retrieval (Knowledge graph traversal) [Week 2]
└── Neural Reranking (Cross-encoder refinement) [Week 3] ← TODAY'S FOCUS
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Neural Foundation (Today)
1. **Cross-encoder Integration**: Set up transformer-based reranking models
2. **Basic Pipeline**: Implement simple neural reranking workflow
3. **Configuration**: Extend YAML config for neural reranking features
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish latency and quality baselines

### Key Technical Components to Build
```
src/components/retrievers/reranking/
├── neural_reranker.py              # Main cross-encoder implementation
├── cross_encoder_models.py         # Model management and caching
├── score_fusion.py                 # Neural + retrieval score combination
├── adaptive_strategies.py          # Query-type aware reranking
└── config/reranking_config.py      # Configuration schema
```

## Performance Targets for Week 3
- **Neural Reranking Latency**: <200ms additional overhead
- **End-to-end Latency**: Maintain <700ms P95 (current: 31ms - large headroom)
- **Quality Enhancement**: >20% improvement in relevance metrics
- **Memory Usage**: <1GB additional for cross-encoder models

## Success Criteria for Today
- [ ] Cross-encoder model integration working
- [ ] Basic neural reranking pipeline operational  
- [ ] Configuration system extended for neural features
- [ ] Performance baseline established (latency + quality)
- [ ] Integration with existing AdvancedRetriever maintained

## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. **Review existing architecture**: Examine current AdvancedRetriever implementation
2. **Set up neural dependencies**: Add required TensorFlow/Keras libraries
3. **Create module structure**: Build neural reranking component hierarchy
4. **Implement basic reranker**: Start with simple cross-encoder integration

### Key Files to Reference
- **Current Implementation**: `src/components/retrievers/advanced_retriever.py`
- **Week 2 Graph Code**: `src/components/retrievers/graph/` (follow patterns)
- **Configuration**: `config/advanced_test.yaml` (extend for neural features)
- **Testing Framework**: `tests/` (maintain comprehensive testing)

### Development Philosophy
- **Maintain Performance**: Neural features must not degrade existing 31ms latency
- **Modular Design**: Follow Week 1-2 patterns for consistency
- **Configuration-driven**: All neural features controllable via YAML
- **Quality-focused**: Measurable improvement in result relevance

## Context Reminders

### What's Already Working (Weeks 1-2)
- **Multi-backend Retrieval**: FAISS + Weaviate with 31ms latency
- **Knowledge Graph**: Entity extraction + relationship mapping operational  
- **Analytics**: Real-time metrics and monitoring framework
- **Testing**: 100% success rates across comprehensive test suites
- **Documentation**: Complete architecture guides and API documentation

### Quality Standards Maintained
- **Swiss Engineering**: Production-ready code with comprehensive error handling
- **Performance-first**: Optimization mindset from embedded systems background
- **Modular Architecture**: Small, testable, single-purpose components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance validation
- **Analytics Integration**: Built-in metrics for all operations

## Ready to Begin

The foundation is solid, all Week 1-2 components are production-ready and validated. Week 3 neural reranking will build upon this excellent foundation to deliver the final enhancement in retrieval quality.

**Let's implement neural reranking and complete the advanced hybrid retriever system!**
