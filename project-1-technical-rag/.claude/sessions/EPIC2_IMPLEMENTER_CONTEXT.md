- **Week 2 Target**: NetworkX for graph algorithms, spaCy for entity extraction
- **Week 3 Future**: Keras/TensorFlow for reranking
- **Week 4 Future**: Plotly Dash for visualization
- **Week 5 Future**: Pandas/NumPy for analytics

## Key Files for Week 2 Implementation:
### Existing Foundation (Week 1):
- `/src/components/retrievers/advanced_retriever.py` - Base to extend for graph features
- `/src/components/retrievers/backends/` - Multi-backend architecture
- `/config/advanced_test.yaml` - Configuration schema for Epic 2

### Week 2 Implementation Targets:
- `/src/components/retrievers/graph/document_graph_builder.py` - NetworkX graph construction
- `/src/components/retrievers/graph/entity_extraction.py` - Technical entity recognition
- `/src/components/retrievers/graph/relationship_mapper.py` - Semantic relationships
- `/src/components/retrievers/graph/graph_retriever.py` - Graph-based search
- `/src/components/retrievers/graph/graph_analytics.py` - Metrics and visualization

## Implementation Standards:
- Apple Silicon MPS optimization for neural reranker
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Performance instrumentation for all retrieval paths
- Swiss engineering quality standards

## Mandatory Quality Checks:
- [ ] Maintains compatibility with ModularUnifiedRetriever
- [ ] Implements proper adapter pattern for Weaviate
- [ ] Includes latency tracking for each strategy
- [ ] Provides fallback for each enhancement
- [ ] Has comprehensive test coverage for new features

## Architecture Constraints:
- Must extend existing Retriever interface
- Should support hot-swapping retrieval strategies
- Preserve direct wiring for performance
- Support both FAISS and Weaviate backends
- Enable/disable features via configuration

## Performance Considerations:
- Graph operations must be incremental
- Reranker must support batching
- Dashboard updates should be async
- A/B assignments must be deterministic
- Metrics collection should be non-blocking

## Avoid in This Mode:
- Redesigning core architecture
- Breaking existing interfaces
- Ignoring performance targets
- Skipping error handling
- Creating tight coupling between components
