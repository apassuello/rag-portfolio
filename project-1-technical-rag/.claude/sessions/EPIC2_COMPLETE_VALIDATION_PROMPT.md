## Get Started

**Your first task**: Begin comprehensive validation by examining the Epic 2 implementation evidence in the AdvancedRetriever and associated components. Start with Phase 1 component validation.

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Verify Implementation Completeness**: Confirm all Epic 2 components are implemented and functional
2. **Performance Validation**: Measure actual performance against targets
3. **Quality Assessment**: Quantify improvement over baseline system
4. **Portfolio Readiness**: Assess against Swiss engineering portfolio standards

**Remember**: This is validation mode - focus on testing and assessment, not implementation changes. The goal is comprehensive evidence gathering for portfolio readiness assessment.

**Evidence Requirement**: All validation claims must be supported by quantitative measurements and real-world testing with RISC-V technical documentation.
