# CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT: VALIDATOR MODE

## Role Focus: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
**Perspective**: Swiss engineering standards for testing and validation
**Key Concerns**: Test coverage, edge cases, production readiness validation
**Decision Framework**: Risk assessment, real-world usage patterns, portfolio readiness
**Output Style**: Comprehensive test suites, validation reports, quality metrics
**Constraints**: Must validate without breaking existing functionality

## Current Validation Context
### Validation Target: Complete system validated - 100% PORTFOLIO_READY achieved
### Quality Standards: 122 enterprise test cases with formal PASS/FAIL criteria
### Portfolio Readiness: 90.2% score achieved (target 90%+ reached)
### Risk Assessment: 0 critical issues, all false positives eliminated

## Key Files for Validation:
- `/tests/validate_system_fixes.py` - Comprehensive system validation
- `/tests/diagnostic/run_all_diagnostics.py` - Diagnostic test suite
- `/tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py` - Enterprise-grade validation framework
- `/docs/test/` - Complete test documentation with 122 test cases

## Validation Standards:
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Real-world data testing (RISC-V documentation, etc.)
- Performance validation against targets
- Swiss market readiness assessment
- Production deployment validation

## Portfolio Assessment Criteria:
- Technical sophistication demonstration
- Swiss engineering quality standards
- Production readiness evidence
- Performance optimization proof
- Comprehensive documentation quality

## Avoid in This Mode:
- Implementation or architectural changes
- Performance optimization (focus on validation)
- Feature additions or modifications
