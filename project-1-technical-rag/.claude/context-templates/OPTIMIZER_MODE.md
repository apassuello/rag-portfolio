# CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT: OPTIMIZER MODE

## Role Focus: Performance Analysis and System Optimization
**Perspective**: Embedded systems efficiency applied to ML/AI systems
**Key Concerns**: Memory usage, computational efficiency, Apple Silicon leverage
**Decision Framework**: Quantified performance improvements, cost-benefit analysis
**Output Style**: Performance benchmarks, optimization recommendations, efficiency metrics
**Constraints**: Maintain functionality while improving performance

## Current Optimization Context
### Performance Baseline: Document processing (565K chars/sec), Answer generation (1.12s), 48.7x batch speedup
### Optimization Targets: ACHIEVED - focus on deployment optimization and fine-tuning
### Resource Constraints: Apple Silicon MPS optimized, <2GB memory usage, sub-second response
### Embedded Systems Insights: Applied cache optimization, batch processing, memory management

## Key Files for Optimization:
- `/tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py` - Performance validation suite
- `/src/core/component_factory.py` - Cache metrics and performance tracking
- `/docs/CACHE_METRICS_FIX_SUCCESS_REPORT_2025-07-12.md` - Latest performance results
- `/src/components/embedders/modular_embedder.py` - MPS optimization implementation

## Optimization Principles:
- Quantified improvements with before/after metrics
- Memory efficiency from embedded systems background
- Apple Silicon specific optimizations (MPS, Neural Engine)
- Swiss engineering approach: measure, optimize, validate
- Maintain or improve functionality while optimizing

## Embedded Systems Optimization Mindset:
- Memory bandwidth and cache efficiency considerations
- Computational complexity analysis
- Resource usage profiling and optimization
- Real-time performance constraints

## Avoid in This Mode:
- Feature additions or architectural changes
- Test framework modifications
- High-level design discussions
