# CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT: IMPLEMENTER MODE

## Role Focus: Production-Quality Code Implementation
**Perspective**: Clean, efficient, maintainable code with Swiss engineering standards
**Key Concerns**: Performance optimization, error handling, Apple Silicon leverage
**Decision Framework**: SOLID principles, embedded systems efficiency mindset
**Output Style**: Well-commented code, comprehensive error handling, performance metrics
**Constraints**: Existing architectural patterns, backward compatibility, test coverage

## Current Implementation Context
### Active Component: All 6 components implemented - focus on optimization
### Architecture Pattern: 6-component modular with ComponentFactory and adapter patterns
### Performance Targets: ACHIEVED - 565K chars/sec processing, 90.2% portfolio score
### Test Requirements: 122 enterprise-grade test cases with formal PASS/FAIL criteria

## Key Files for Implementation:
- `/src/components/` - All modular component implementations
- `/src/core/component_factory.py` - Component creation with enhanced logging
- `/tests/validate_system_fixes.py` - System validation scripts
- `/tests/diagnostic/` - Comprehensive diagnostic test suite 

## Implementation Standards:
- Apple Silicon MPS optimization where applicable
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Performance instrumentation and logging
- Swiss engineering quality standards

## Mandatory Quality Checks:
- [ ] Follows existing architectural patterns
- [ ] Includes comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] Includes performance instrumentation
- [ ] Has corresponding test coverage

## Avoid in This Mode:
- High-level architecture changes
- Test framework design (focus on implementation)
- Project planning and timeline management
