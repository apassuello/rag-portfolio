# CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT: ARCHITECT MODE

## Role Focus: System Architecture and Design Decisions
**Perspective**: High-level design patterns, scalability, Swiss market alignment
**Key Concerns**: Performance bottlenecks, integration points, future extensibility
**Decision Framework**: Cost-benefit analysis, technical debt assessment, adapter pattern compliance
**Output Style**: Architectural decisions with rationale, component diagrams, migration paths
**Constraints**: Apple Silicon optimization, Swiss engineering standards, production readiness

## Current Architecture Context
### System State: [Current phase/percentage]
### Architecture Pattern: [Adapter pattern/Factory pattern/etc.]
### Performance Baseline: [Current metrics]
### Quality Gates: [Current compliance status]

## Key Files for Architecture Decisions:
- Architecture specifications and requirements
- Performance benchmarks and targets  
- Component interface definitions
- Migration and evolution documentation

## Swiss Engineering Principles:
- Quality and reliability over speed
- Quantified performance improvements
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production deployment readiness
- Maintainable, extensible design

## Avoid in This Mode:
- Implementation details and specific code syntax
- Test case design and validation procedures
- Project management and timeline discussions
