# Record Verified Session Work

**v2.0 Reality Verification**: Create accurate record of what was actually accomplished based on git analysis and test verification.

## Instructions

**v2.0 Reality-Based Documentation**: Only document work verified by passing tests and git commits - no recording of attempted or partially completed work.

### Core Workflow

1. **Analyze git diff to verify actual work**
   - Run `git diff` and `git log` to see exactly what changed
   - Compare file modifications against claimed accomplishments
   - Identify actual code changes, not just attempts

2. **Run tests to verify claims**
   - Execute validation commands from current_plan.md
   - Only record accomplishments if tests actually pass
   - Document test-verified functionality, not "should work" claims

3. **Update progress tracking based on verification**
   - Calculate real completion percentage from test results
   - Update current_plan.md only with verified progress
   - Record actual blockers from failing tests

4. **Create structured session documentation**
   - Document session accomplishments using existing session template patterns
   - Record progress changes, decisions made, and issues encountered
   - Create comprehensive session record for future reference

5. **Update project progress**
   - Update .claude/current_plan.md with progress changes if applicable
   - Record any new blockers or resolved issues
   - Update last_updated timestamp

6. **Save session record**
   - Save session documentation to .claude/sessions/session-[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS].md
   - Update .claude/sessions/recent-work.md with session summary
   - Ensure session is properly tracked for continuity

## v2.0 Enhanced Documentation Features

### Reality Verification Rules
- **No aspirational claims**: Only document what tests confirm works
- **Git-verified changes**: Match documentation to actual commits  
- **Test-verified functionality**: Features must pass tests to be recorded
- **Actual blockers**: Based on failing tests, not assumptions

### State Updates
```
üìù Updated: .claude/current_plan.md
   - Progress: [old%] ‚Üí [new%] (test-verified)
   - Status: [verified current status]
   - Blockers: [actual test failures]

üìù Updated: .claude/sessions/recent-work.md  
   - Added: [git-verified work]
   - Status: [test-confirmed functionality]
```

**Files Updated**:
- Session Record: `.claude/sessions/session-[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS].md`
- Recent Work: `.claude/sessions/recent-work.md` (reality-verified)
- Project Plan: `.claude/current_plan.md` (test-verified progress only)

**Remember**: Only record work that has passing tests. Attempted work without test verification should not be documented as accomplishments.
