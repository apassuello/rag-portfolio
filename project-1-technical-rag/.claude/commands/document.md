   - Review current_task, progress, and milestone information

2. **Analyze actual work accomplished**
   - Review recent git commits to understand work completed
   - Analyze changes made during current session
   - Compare planned vs actual work accomplished

3. **Execute validation for current state**
   - Run validation commands from current_plan.md
   - Capture current system state and quality metrics
   - Document validation results and compliance status

4. **Create structured session documentation**
   - Document session accomplishments using existing session template patterns
   - Record progress changes, decisions made, and issues encountered
   - Create comprehensive session record for future reference

5. **Update project progress**
   - Update @current_plan.md with progress changes if applicable
   - Record any new blockers or resolved issues
   - Update last_updated timestamp

6. **Save session record**
   - Save session documentation to @sessions/session-[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS].md
