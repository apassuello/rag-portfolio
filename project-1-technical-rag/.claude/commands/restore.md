# Restore Context After Compaction

**Usage**: `/restore [work-area]`  
**Purpose**: Quickly restore context and working state after automatic conversation compaction

## Quick Restoration Commands

### **For Epic 2 Demo Work**
```bash
/restore epic2-demo
# Executes:
# /context epic2-demo
# /implementer streamlit-ui  
# /status epic2
```

### **For Neural Reranker Work**
```bash
/restore neural-reranker
# Executes:
# /context neural-reranker
# /implementer neural-reranker
# /status performance
```

### **For Architecture Review**
```bash
/restore architecture
# Executes:
# /context component-boundaries
# /architect epic2-demo
# /status architecture
```

### **For Testing Work**
```bash
/restore testing
# Executes:
# /context validation
# /validator diagnostic
# /status tests
```

## Instructions

Load context restoration guidance and provide quick restart commands for the specified work area.

## Context Recovery Strategy

**Immediate Actions** (execute automatically):
1. **Load Context**: Restore context for the specified work area
2. **Set Role**: Switch to appropriate role for the work area
3. **Check Status**: Validate current system state
4. **Verify Health**: Quick system health check

## Emergency Recovery

If unsure of previous work area:
1. Check `@current_plan.md` for current task
2. Check `@sessions/recent-work.md` for latest activity  
3. Use `/status` for overall system state
4. Use `/context` for general project context

Context restored. Development work can continue without interruption.
