# Determine Next Logical Development Task

Determine the next logical development task based on current project state and progress.

## Instructions

1. **Read current project state**
   - Read .claude/current_plan.md for current task, progress, and milestone information
   - Review current_task completion status and progress percentage

2. **Read recent session activity**
   - Read .claude/sessions/recent-work.md for recent development activity
   - Understand what work has been completed recently

3. **Execute validation commands**
   - Run validation commands from current_plan.md to check current system state
   - Assess completion status of current task based on validation results

4. **Analyze task progression**
   - Determine if current task is complete or needs additional work
   - Identify logical next task based on project milestones and dependencies

5. **Update project plan if transitioning**
   - If current task is complete, update .claude/current_plan.md with next task
   - Update progress, current_phase, and next_milestone as appropriate
   - Specify new context_requirements for next task
