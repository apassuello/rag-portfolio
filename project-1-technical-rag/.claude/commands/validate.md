# Execute Validation Commands

Execute validation commands to assess current project state and quality.

## Instructions

1. **Read validation configuration**
   - Read .claude/current_plan.md for validation_commands array
   - Review validation commands specified for current project state

2. **Execute validation commands**
   - Run each validation command listed in validation_commands
   - Capture output, exit codes, and any error messages
   - Handle timeouts and command failures gracefully

3. **Interpret validation results**
   - Analyze output from each validation command
   - Determine pass/fail status and quality metrics
   - Identify any critical issues or failures

4. **Update validation tracking**
   - Update .claude/sessions/validation-results.md with current validation status
   - Record timestamp, commands executed, and results summary
   - Track validation history and trends

5. **Provide actionable summary**
   - Summarize validation results with clear pass/fail status
   - Highlight critical issues that need attention
   - Recommend next actions based on validation outcomes
