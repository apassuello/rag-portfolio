## Usage Guide

### Quick Start for Demo Implementation

1. **Context Gathering**: Review `context/epic2_status.md` for current system status
2. **File Reference**: Use `context/key_files.md` for important file locations  
3. **Requirements**: Check `context/demo_requirements.md` for specifications
4. **Implementation**: Follow prompts in `prompts/demo_implementation.md`
