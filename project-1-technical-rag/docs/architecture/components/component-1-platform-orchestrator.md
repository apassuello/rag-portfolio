# Component 1: Platform Orchestrator

**Component ID**: C1  
**Version**: 1.0  
**References**: [MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md](./MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md)  
**Related Components**: All (C2-C6)

---

## 1. Component Overview

### 1.1 Purpose & Responsibility

The Platform Orchestrator serves as the **central coordination point** for the entire RAG system:
- System lifecycle management (startup, shutdown, health)
- Component initialization and dependency injection
- Request routing and response coordination
- Cross-cutting concerns (monitoring, configuration)

### 1.2 Position in System

**Central Hub Pattern**: All external requests flow through the orchestrator, which delegates to appropriate components.

**Key Relationships**:
- **Creates**: All other components (C2-C6)
- **Coordinates**: Document processing and query workflows
- **Monitors**: System health and performance

### 1.3 Key Design Decisions

1. **Single Entry Point**: Simplifies API and security management
2. **Direct Wiring**: Components wired at initialization, not runtime
3. **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled via YAML configuration

---

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

**Core Capabilities**:
- FR1: Initialize system with validated configuration
- FR2: Process documents through complete pipeline
- FR3: Handle queries end-to-end
- FR4: Provide system health and metrics
- FR5: Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup

**Interface Contracts**: See [Platform Orchestrator Interface](./rag-interface-reference.md#2-main-component-interfaces)

**Behavioral Specifications**:
- Must validate all components healthy before accepting requests
- Must handle component failures gracefully
- Must maintain request context through entire pipeline

### 2.2 Quality Requirements

**Performance**:
- Initialization: <200ms (excluding model loading)
- Request routing overhead: <5ms
- Health check response: <25ms

**Reliability**:
- 99.9% uptime for orchestration layer
- Graceful degradation if components fail
- Automatic recovery from transient failures

**Scalability**:
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Support for 1000+ concurrent requests

**Security**: See [MASTER Section 3.6](./MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md#36-security-architecture)

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1 Internal Structure

```
Platform Orchestrator
├── Configuration Manager (sub-component)
├── Lifecycle Manager (sub-component)
├── Request Router
├── Component Registry
└── Monitoring Collector (sub-component)
```

### 3.2 Sub-Components

**Configuration Manager**:
- **Purpose**: Load and validate system configuration
- **Implementation**: Direct (YAML, ENV) or Adapter (Consul)
- **Decision**: Use adapter only for remote config services

**Lifecycle Manager**:
- **Purpose**: Component initialization and dependency management
- **Implementation**: Direct (all variants)
- **Decision**: No external services, pure orchestration logic

**Monitoring Collector**:
- **Purpose**: Aggregate metrics from all components
- **Implementation**: Adapter for external systems (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
- **Decision**: Different metrics formats require adaptation

### 3.3 Adapter vs Direct

See [MASTER Section 2.3](./MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md#23-adapter-pattern-guidelines)

**Uses Adapters For**:
- Remote configuration services
- External monitoring systems

**Direct Implementation For**:
- Lifecycle management
- Request routing
- Health checking

### 3.4 State Management

**Stateless Operation**:
- No request state maintained
- Component references held but immutable after init
- Configuration cached but refreshable

---

## 4. Interfaces

### 4.1 Provided Interfaces

**Primary API**: See [Platform Orchestrator Interface](./rag-interface-reference.md#2-main-component-interfaces)
- `process_document(file_path) -> int`
- `process_query(query, k) -> Answer`
- `get_system_health() -> Dict`

### 4.2 Required Interfaces

From other components:
- All component constructors
- Component health check methods
- Component metric collection methods

### 4.3 Events Published

- System initialized
- Component health changed
- Request completed/failed

### 4.4 Events Consumed

- Configuration updated
- Shutdown requested

---

## 5. Design Rationale

### Architectural Decisions

**AD1: Central Orchestrator Pattern**
- **Decision**: Single orchestrator vs distributed coordination
- **Rationale**: Simpler to understand, debug, and monitor
- **Trade-off**: Potential bottleneck, but stateless design mitigates

**AD2: Direct Component References**
- **Decision**: Hold direct refs vs service locator
- **Rationale**: Better performance, type safety
- **Trade-off**: Less dynamic, but configuration provides flexibility

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Microservices with Message Queue**: Rejected due to complexity
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Rejected, component factory sufficient
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Rejected for main flow, too complex

---

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### Current Implementation Notes

- Uses Phase 4 architecture with Component Factory
- Achieved 20% startup performance improvement
- Health monitoring includes dependency validation

### Best Practices

1. **Always validate configuration** before component creation
2. **Initialize components in dependency order**
3. **Use health checks** before accepting traffic
4. **Log all state transitions** for debugging

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't create circular dependencies between components
- Don't hold request state in orchestrator
- Don't bypass orchestrator for inter-component communication

### Performance Considerations

- Cache configuration validation results
- Use lazy initialization for optional components
- Implement connection pooling for external services

## 7. Configuration

### Configuration Schema

See [Configuration Schema](./rag-interface-reference.md#4-configuration-schemas)

### Key Settings

```yaml
platform:
  initialization:
    timeout: 30s
    parallel: false
  health_check:
    interval: 60s
    timeout: 10s
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
    collector: prometheus
```

---

## 8. Operations

### Health Checks

**Endpoint**: `/health`
- Aggregates all component health
- Returns degraded if any non-critical component unhealthy
- Includes dependency verification

### Metrics Exposed

- `orchestrator_requests_total`
- `orchestrator_request_duration_seconds`
- `orchestrator_errors_total`
- `component_health_status`

### Logging Strategy

- Structured logging with request correlation ID
- INFO: Request lifecycle events
- WARN: Component degradation
- ERROR: Request failures

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Slow startup | Model loading | Pre-warm models |
| High latency | Component bottleneck | Check component metrics |
| Memory growth | Request state leak | Verify stateless operation |

## 9. Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Change settings without restart
2. **Request Prioritization**: QoS for different request types
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Tracing and profiling integration

### Extension Points

- Custom health check strategies
- Pluggable monitoring backends
- Request interceptors for preprocessing

### Known Limitations

- Single point of failure (mitigated by stateless design)
- No built-in request queuing (use external queue if needed)
- Configuration changes require restart
