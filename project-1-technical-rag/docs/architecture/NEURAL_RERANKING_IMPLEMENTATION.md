# Supported backends for maximum flexibility
backends = {
    "sentence_transformers": "sentence-transformers library (primary)",
    "tensorflow": "TensorFlow/Keras models",
    "keras": "Keras-optimized inference"
}
```

**3. Adaptive Strategy Pattern**
```python
# Query-type aware model selection
query_strategies = {
    "technical": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base",
    "general": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2", 
    "comparative": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base",
    "procedural": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2",

The neural reranking is seamlessly integrated as the 4th stage:

```python
class AdvancedRetriever(ModularUnifiedRetriever):
    def retrieve(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> List[RetrievalResult]:
        # Stages 1-3: Existing multi-modal retrieval
        results = self._retrieve_with_backend(query, k, self.active_backend_name)
        
        # Stage 4: Neural reranking (NEW)
        results = self._apply_neural_reranking(query, results)
        
        return results
    
    def _apply_neural_reranking(self, query, results):
        if not self.neural_reranker or not results:
            return results
        
        # Convert to neural reranker format
        documents = [result.document for result in results]
        initial_scores = [result.score for result in results]
        
        # Apply neural reranking
        reranked_indices_scores = self.neural_reranker.rerank(
            query=query,
            documents=documents, 
            initial_scores=initial_scores
        )
        
        # Convert back to RetrievalResults with enhanced metadata
        return self._create_reranked_results(results, reranked_indices_scores)
```

### Configuration Integration

Neural reranking integrates with existing AdvancedRetrieverConfig:

```yaml
retriever:
  type: "advanced"
  config:
    neural_reranking:
      enabled: true
      model_name: "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2"
      max_candidates: 50
      batch_size: 16
      max_latency_ms: 200
      device: "auto"
```

## Enhanced Configuration System

### Backward Compatibility Architecture

```python
class EnhancedNeuralRerankingConfig:
    @classmethod
    def from_base_config(cls, base_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Convert base NeuralRerankingConfig to enhanced version"""
        
    def to_base_config(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Convert to base format for backward compatibility"""
```

### Advanced Configuration Features

**1. Multiple Model Support**:

models = {
    "default_model": ModelConfig(
        name="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        backend="sentence_transformers",
        batch_size=16
    ),
    "technical_model": ModelConfig(
        name="cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base",
        backend="sentence_transformers", 
        batch_size=8
    )
}
```

**2. Adaptive Strategy Configuration**:
```python
adaptive = AdaptiveConfig(
    enabled=True,
    query_classification=QueryClassificationConfig(
        enabled=True,
        strategies={
            "technical": "technical_model",

        }
    )
)
```

**3. Performance Optimization Settings**:
```python
performance = PerformanceConfig(
    max_latency_ms=200,
    target_latency_ms=150,
    dynamic_batching=True,
    enable_caching=True,
    cache_ttl_seconds=3600
)
```

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Graceful Degradation Strategy

```python
def _apply_neural_reranking(self, query, results):
    try:
        # Neural reranking pipeline
        return enhanced_results
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Neural reranking failed: {e}")
        # Return original results - no functionality loss
        return results
```

### Fallback Mechanisms
