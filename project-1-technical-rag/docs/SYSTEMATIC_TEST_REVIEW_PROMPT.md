# Systematic Test Suite Review Prompt

## Overview
This prompt provides a structured approach to systematically review all test suites in the comprehensive test runner to understand system behavior, identify patterns, and extract actionable insights.

## Test Suite Structure
The comprehensive test runner consists of 6 test suites:
1. **System Validation** - Basic system health and readiness
2. **Comprehensive Integration Testing** - End-to-end pipeline validation
3. **Component-Specific Testing** - Individual component behavior analysis
4. **Cross-Test Analysis** - Consistency validation across test suites
5. **Portfolio Readiness Assessment** - Overall system readiness scoring
6. **Optimization Recommendations** - Actionable improvement suggestions
