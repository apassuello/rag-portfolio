## 🔄 Architecture Compliance Journey

### Challenge Identified (July 16)
After implementation, comprehensive architecture review revealed violations of Component Factory, Adapter, and direct wiring principles due to parallel component hierarchies.

### Refactoring Solution Implemented
**Phase 0: AdvancedRetriever Cleanup**
- Removed bypass methods violating delegation patterns
- Restored clean configuration-only extension pattern

**Phase 1: Neural Reranking Architecture Compliance**
- Moved from separate `reranking/` to proper `rerankers/` sub-component
- Created `NeuralReranker` implementing Reranker interface
- Integrated through ModularUnifiedRetriever configuration

**Phase 2: Graph Integration Architecture Compliance**  
- Moved from separate `graph/` to proper `fusion/` sub-component
- Created `GraphEnhancedRRFFusion` extending FusionStrategy
- Integrated graph signals as fusion enhancement

**Phase 3: Weaviate Integration Architecture Compliance**
- Created `WeaviateIndex` as proper VectorIndex adapter
- Added Weaviate support to ModularUnifiedRetriever
- Implemented proper delegation patterns

### Result: Complete Architecture Compliance ✅
- **Component Factory Pattern**: Centralized creation maintained
- **Adapter Pattern**: Proper external service integration (Weaviate)
- **Direct Wiring**: Clean delegation without runtime factory lookups
- **Configuration Extension**: AdvancedRetriever configures parent, doesn't replace
