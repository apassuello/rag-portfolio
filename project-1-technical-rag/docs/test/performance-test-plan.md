## 1. Performance Test Strategy

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive performance testing strategy for the RAG Technical Documentation System. Performance testing validates that the system meets its stated performance requirements, identifies bottlenecks, and ensures the system can handle expected loads while maintaining quality of service.

### 1.2 Performance Testing Philosophy

Performance testing goes beyond simple speed measurements to understand system behavior under various conditions. The approach focuses on establishing performance baselines, identifying optimization opportunities, and validating that architectural decisions support performance goals. Testing considers not just individual component performance but also system-wide behavior under realistic usage patterns.

### 1.3 Performance Requirements Summary

The architecture specifications define clear performance targets that must be validated:

**Document Processing Performance**: The system must process documents at >1M characters per second, enabling rapid ingestion of large documentation sets.

**Retrieval Performance**: Search operations must complete with <10ms average latency, ensuring responsive user experience.

**End-to-End Performance**: Complete query processing from input to answer must complete within 2 seconds for 95% of queries.

**Scalability Requirements**: The system must support 10M+ documents and handle 1000+ concurrent requests while maintaining performance targets.

## 2. Performance Test Categories

### 2.1 Component Performance Tests

Component performance tests establish baseline performance for each individual component, identifying optimization opportunities and validating that each component meets its specific performance requirements.

### 2.2 Integration Performance Tests

Integration performance tests measure the overhead introduced at component boundaries and validate that data transformations and communications between components don't introduce unacceptable latency.

### 2.3 System Performance Tests

System performance tests validate end-to-end performance under realistic usage patterns, including concurrent users, mixed workloads, and sustained operation.

### 2.4 Scalability Tests

Scalability tests determine system limits and validate that performance degrades gracefully as load increases. These tests identify the point at which additional resources are required.

### 2.5 Stress Tests

Stress tests push the system beyond normal operating conditions to identify breaking points and validate recovery mechanisms.
