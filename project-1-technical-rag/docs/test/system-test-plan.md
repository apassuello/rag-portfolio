## 1. System Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the system testing approach for validating that the complete RAG Technical Documentation System meets its functional requirements, quality attributes, and provides the expected user experience. System testing treats the entire system as a black box, focusing on end-to-end workflows and real-world usage scenarios.

### 1.2 System Test Philosophy

System testing validates the system from the user's perspective, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly to deliver business value. Unlike integration testing which focuses on component interactions, system testing validates complete user journeys and ensures the system behaves correctly as a whole under realistic conditions.

### 1.3 Test Approach

System testing employs scenario-based testing that reflects actual usage patterns. Tests are designed around user stories and business workflows, validating not just functional correctness but also non-functional requirements like performance, reliability, and usability. The approach emphasizes realistic data volumes, concurrent usage patterns, and production-like conditions.

## 2. System Test Scenarios

### 2.1 Core Business Scenarios

The system must support the following primary business scenarios that represent the core value proposition of the RAG system:

**Technical Documentation Search** enables engineers to quickly find specific implementation details in technical manuals. This scenario validates the system's ability to understand technical queries and return precise, relevant information with proper source attribution.

**Cross-Document Knowledge Synthesis** allows users to ask questions that require information from multiple documents. This scenario tests the system's ability to combine information intelligently and provide comprehensive answers.

**Constraint-Aware Retrieval** helps engineers understand hardware limitations and compatibility requirements. This scenario validates domain-specific understanding and the ability to provide contextually appropriate answers.

### 2.2 User Personas and Workflows

System testing considers three primary user personas, each with distinct needs and usage patterns:

**Embedded Systems Engineer** needs quick access to register definitions, memory maps, and implementation examples. They typically ask specific technical questions and require accurate code snippets and specifications.

**Technical Support Engineer** requires comprehensive troubleshooting information and needs to understand system interactions. They often ask "why" and "how" questions that require explanatory answers.

**New Team Member** needs educational content and context about system architecture. They ask broader questions and benefit from comprehensive explanations with background information.
