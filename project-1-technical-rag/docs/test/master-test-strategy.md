## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for validating that the RAG Technical Documentation System implementation conforms to its architectural specifications. The strategy emphasizes Swiss engineering standards with rigorous quality gates, traceable requirements coverage, and systematic validation of both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Key Principles

1. **Specification-Driven Testing**: Every test traces back to architectural requirements
2. **Multi-Level Validation**: From unit to system level, ensuring quality at each layer
3. **Automated Execution**: Tests must be repeatable and CI/CD compatible
4. **Measurable Quality**: Quantitative metrics for all quality attributes

---

## 2. Test Scope and Objectives

### 2.1 In Scope

- Functional correctness of all components and sub-components
- Performance validation against stated targets
- Interface contract verification
- Architectural pattern compliance
- Operational readiness validation
- Security and resilience testing

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- User interface testing (no UI in current architecture)
- Business logic validation (technical system)
- Third-party service testing (only integration points)

### 2.3 Test Objectives

1. **Verify Functional Requirements**: Ensure each component performs its specified functions
2. **Validate Quality Attributes**: Confirm performance, reliability, and scalability targets
3. **Ensure Architectural Integrity**: Verify design patterns are correctly implemented
4. **Confirm Operational Readiness**: Validate monitoring, health checks, and deployment

## 3. Test Levels and Types

### 3.1 Test Levels Hierarchy

```
System Tests
