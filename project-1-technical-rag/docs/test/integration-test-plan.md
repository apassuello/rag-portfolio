## 1. Integration Test Strategy

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the integration testing approach for validating that the six main components of the RAG system work together correctly according to the architectural specifications. Integration testing focuses on the interfaces between components, data flow validation, and ensuring that the direct wiring pattern functions as designed.

### 1.2 Integration Test Scope

The integration tests validate the interactions between adjacent components in the system architecture, ensuring that data flows correctly through the processing pipeline and that component dependencies are properly managed. Unlike unit tests which test components in isolation, integration tests verify that real components work together with actual data and dependencies.

### 1.3 Testing Principles

Integration testing follows a systematic approach that builds confidence incrementally. We start with simple two-component integrations and progressively test larger subsystems until we validate the complete system integration. Each test focuses on verifying data contracts, error propagation, performance characteristics, and architectural compliance at integration points.

## 2. Component Integration Matrix

### 2.1 Direct Integration Points

The following matrix identifies all direct integration points between components based on the architecture:

| Component A | Component B | Integration Type | Data Flow | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Platform Orchestrator | Document Processor | Control + Data | Documents → Chunks | High |
| Platform Orchestrator | Query Processor | Control + Data | Queries → Answers | High |
| Document Processor | Embedder | Data Pipeline | Chunks → Embeddings | High |
| Embedder | Retriever | Data Pipeline | Embeddings → Index | High |
| Query Processor | Retriever | Request/Response | Query → Results | High |
| Query Processor | Answer Generator | Request/Response | Context → Answer | High |
| Platform Orchestrator | All Components | Lifecycle | Config + Health | High |

### 2.2 Integration Test Categories

Integration tests are organized into three categories based on scope and complexity:

**Bilateral Integration Tests** validate the interaction between two directly connected components. These tests ensure that data formats, error handling, and performance characteristics meet specifications at each integration point.

**Pipeline Integration Tests** validate complete data flow through multiple components. These tests ensure that data transformations are correct and that no information is lost as data moves through the processing pipeline.

**System Integration Tests** validate the complete system working together. These tests ensure that all components collaborate correctly to deliver end-to-end functionality.

## 5. Integration Test Environment

### 5.1 Environment Setup

The integration test environment should closely mirror the production environment to ensure valid test results. This includes using the same component configurations, hardware specifications where relevant, and external service versions. The environment must support rapid test execution while maintaining isolation between test runs.

### 5.2 Test Data Management

Integration tests require consistent test data that exercises component interactions thoroughly. Test data should be version controlled and include both typical cases and edge cases. Data setup and teardown procedures must ensure clean state between test runs to prevent test interference.

### 5.3 Service Dependencies

External services like Ollama and Redis should be containerized for consistent test environments. Mock services may be used for expensive operations, but critical paths should be tested with real services to validate actual integration behavior.

## 6. Integration Test Execution

### 6.1 Test Execution Order

Integration tests should be executed in a specific order that builds confidence incrementally:

1. **Bilateral Integrations First**: Test each pair of directly connected components
2. **Pipeline Integrations Next**: Test complete data flow paths
3. **System Integrations Last**: Test full system interactions

This approach helps isolate integration issues to specific component pairs before testing more complex interactions.

### 6.2 Continuous Integration

Integration tests should run on every merge to the main branch, with a subset of critical integration tests running on every pull request. The full integration suite should run nightly to catch any regression issues early.

### 6.3 Performance Monitoring

During integration testing, performance metrics should be collected to identify any performance degradation at integration points. This includes monitoring data transformation overhead, network latency between services, and memory usage patterns during component interactions.

---

## 7. Defect Categorization

### 7.1 Integration Defect Types

Integration defects typically fall into several categories that help guide resolution:

**Data Contract Violations** occur when components pass data in unexpected formats. These are often caught early but can cause cascading failures if not addressed.

**Performance Degradation** at integration points often indicates inefficient data transformation or excessive network calls. These issues may only appear under load.

**Error Handling Gaps** become apparent when error conditions cross component boundaries. Proper error context must be maintained through the integration chain.

**Configuration Mismatches** happen when components have inconsistent configuration assumptions. These can be subtle and may only appear in specific scenarios.

### 7.2 Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Integration completely broken, no workaround
- **High**: Major functionality impaired, difficult workaround
- **Medium**: Some functionality affected, workaround available
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

---

## 8. Exit Criteria

### 8.1 Integration Test Completion

Integration testing is considered complete when:

1. All identified integration points have been tested
2. Data flow validation shows no data loss or corruption
3. Performance at integration points meets specifications
4. Error propagation works correctly across components
5. Configuration changes propagate as designed
6. All critical and high severity defects are resolved

### 8.2 Quality Metrics

The following metrics indicate integration quality:

- **Data Integrity**: Zero data corruption issues
- **Performance**: Integration overhead <10% of total time
- **Error Handling**: 100% of error scenarios handled
- **Compatibility**: All component versions compatible

### 8.3 Sign-off Requirements
