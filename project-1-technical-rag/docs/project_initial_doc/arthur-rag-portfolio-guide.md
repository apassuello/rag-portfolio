# Arthur's RAG Portfolio Development Guide

*A comprehensive 16-week roadmap for building production-grade RAG systems that showcase advanced ML engineering skills while maintaining budget efficiency*

## üéØ Strategic Overview

### Portfolio Goals
- Build 3 production-ready RAG systems demonstrating progression from technical documentation to enterprise-grade platforms
- Showcase deep ML understanding through custom implementations and optimizations
- Position as an embedded systems expert transitioning to advanced ML engineering
- Complete within 12-16 weeks while conducting job search

### Model Strategy: Hybrid Approach (70% Self-Hosted, 30% API)

**Why Self-Hosted Models:**
- Demonstrates real ML engineering skills beyond API usage
- Budget-friendly with one-time compute costs
- Showcases optimization expertise (quantization, caching, serving)
- Enables custom fine-tuning and architecture modifications
- Differentiates from candidates who only use APIs

**Strategic API Usage:**
- Baseline performance comparisons
- Complex reasoning tasks requiring SOTA performance
- Rapid prototyping before optimization
- Production fallback systems
