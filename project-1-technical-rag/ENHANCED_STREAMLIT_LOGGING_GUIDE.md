# Enhanced Streamlit Demo Logging Guide 🎛️

## 🎯 **Your Streamlit Demo Now Has Enhanced Logging!**

I've enhanced the `demo/utils/system_integration.py` file to show detailed improvement metrics in the console when you run the Streamlit demo.

## 🚀 **How to Launch Enhanced Demo**

### Method 1: Enhanced Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
# Launch with enhanced logging and console metrics
python run_enhanced_streamlit_demo.py
```

### Method 2: Standard Launcher (Still Enhanced)
```bash
# The original launcher now includes enhanced logging too
python run_epic2_demo.py --demo-mode
```

### Method 3: Direct Streamlit (Also Enhanced)
```bash
# Direct launch still shows enhanced logging
streamlit run streamlit_epic2_demo.py
```

3. **Success Confirmation**: All improvements working

## 🔍 **Key Console Messages to Watch For**

### ✅ **Success Indicators**

#### Graph Enhancement Working:
```
✅ GRAPH ENHANCEMENT DETECTED: GraphEnhancedRRFFusion
✅ IMPROVEMENT ACTIVE: Real graph enhancement with spaCy entity extraction
```

#### Source Attribution Fixed:
```
✅ SOURCE ATTRIBUTION FIXED: SemanticScorer
📝 CITATIONS DETECTED: X citations found in answer
✅ IMPROVEMENT VALIDATED: Source attribution generating proper citations
```

#### Neural Reranking Active:
```
✅ NEURAL RERANKING DETECTED: NeuralReranker
✅ IMPROVEMENT ACTIVE: Neural reranking providing confidence boosts
```

### ⚠️ **What to Check If Improvements Don't Show**

#### If No Graph Enhancement:
```
ℹ️ Standard fusion: RRFFusion
```
→ Check config file is using `epic2.yaml` or similar with graph features

#### If No Neural Reranking:
```
ℹ️ Basic reranking: IdentityReranker
```
→ Verify neural reranking is enabled in configuration

#### If Source Attribution Issues:
- No citation detection messages
- SemanticScorer parameter errors
→ Check that configuration fixes were applied

## 🧪 **Test Your Improvements**

### Test Sequence:
1. **Launch**: `python run_enhanced_streamlit_demo.py`
2. **Initialize**: Click "Initialize Epic 2 System" 
3. **Check Console**: Look for improvement detection messages
4. **Query**: Submit "How does RISC-V handle atomic operations?"
5. **Monitor**: Watch real-time improvement tracking
6. **Validate**: Confirm citations in generated answer

### Expected Results:
- ✅ All 3 improvements detected during initialization
- ✅ Real-time tracking during query processing  
- ✅ Citations appearing in generated answers
- ✅ Performance metrics showing reasonable timing

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Your enhanced logging is working if you see:

✅ **Initialization**:
- "EPIC 2 IMPROVEMENTS ACTIVE" with all 3 improvements listed
- Component detection messages for Graph/Neural/Source fixes

✅ **Query Processing**:
- "IMPROVEMENT TRACKING" messages during retrieval and generation
- Real-time component validation
- Citation detection confirmation

✅ **Results**:
- Improvement summary with quantified metrics
- Citations visible in Streamlit interface
- No configuration errors

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Enhanced Logging**

### If No Enhanced Logs Appear:
```bash
# Check if changes were applied
grep -n "IMPROVEMENT TRACKING" demo/utils/system_integration.py
# Should show the enhanced logging line
```

### If Demo Won't Start:
```bash
# Try the original launcher
python run_epic2_demo.py --demo-mode

# Or direct Streamlit
streamlit run streamlit_epic2_demo.py
```

### If Improvements Not Detected:
- Verify you're using Epic 2 configuration
- Check config files have been fixed (SemanticScorer parameters)
- Ensure spaCy model is installed: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Keep Terminal Visible**: The console logging is where the magic happens!

2. **Test Multiple Queries**: Each query shows the improvements working

3. **Watch Timing**: Enhanced logging shows realistic performance metrics

4. **Check Citations**: Look for `[Document X]` style citations in answers

5. **Monitor Components**: Component detection happens during initialization

Your Streamlit demo now provides comprehensive evidence that your improvements are working! 🎉
