3. **Component Architecture**: Should show:
   - Retriever: ModularUnifiedRetriever (Epic 2)
   - Fusion: GraphEnhancedRRFFusion ✅
   - Reranker: NeuralReranker ✅

### Page 2: Interactive Query
1. **Submit Test Query**: Try "How does RISC-V handle atomic operations?"
2. **Watch Processing Stages**:
   - 🔍 Dense Retrieval: ~50ms
   - 📝 Sparse Retrieval: ~30ms  
   - 🕸️ Graph Enhancement: ~50ms ← **Your improvement!**
   - 🧠 Neural Reranking: ~200ms ← **Your improvement!**

3. **Check Results**: Look for:
   - Citations in generated answer
   - Neural boost values (+0.XX confidence)
   - Graph connections (X related docs)

### Page 3: Results Analysis
- **Neural Reranking Impact**: Shows confidence boosts per result
- **Graph Enhancement**: Shows document relationships
- **Answer Quality**: Citations and source attribution

## 🎛️ **Key Improvements to Observe**

### A. Graph Enhancement (Your 554% Improvement!)
**What to Look For**:
```
🕸️ Graph Enhancement: ✅ 50ms • 5 results
```
- Should show ~50ms processing time
- Results should have "graph connections" metadata
- Processing stage should complete successfully

**Console Logs** (if using enhanced logging):
```
Graph enhancement entity extraction: 15 entities found
Graph boost calculation: 5.83% boost applied
```

### B. Source Attribution (Your 100% Success Rate!)
**What to Look For**:
- Generated answers should contain citations like `[Document 1]`
- Source documents should be properly attributed
- No configuration errors during system initialization

**Console Logs**:
```
Citations detected: 3 found in answer
MockLLMAdapter correctly instantiated
```

### C. Neural Reranking (Active vs Basic)
**What to Look For**:
```
🧠 Neural Reranking: ✅ 200ms • 10 results
```
- Should show "NeuralReranker" in system overview
- Results should have "neural_boost" values
- Processing time ~200ms for reranking

## 🔍 **Best Test Queries**

### Graph Enhancement Triggers
```
"How does RISC-V handle atomic operations?"
"RISC-V memory model and synchronization"
"RV32 vs RV64 architecture differences"
```

### Neural Reranking Tests  
```
"What are the main RISC-V instruction formats?"
"Explain RISC-V vector extension capabilities"
"RISC-V privilege levels and modes"
```

### Source Attribution Tests
```
"RISC-V specification details"
"Implementation requirements for RISC-V"
"RISC-V compliance testing"
```

## 📊 **Expected Demo Behavior**

### ✅ **Working Improvements** (What You Should See)

1. **System Overview**:
   - "Epic 2 Features Active: Neural Reranking, Graph Enhanced Fusion, Hybrid Search"
   - Component architecture showing GraphEnhancedRRFFusion
   - No initialization errors

2. **Query Processing**:
   - All 4 stages complete successfully
   - Graph Enhancement shows results count
   - Neural Reranking shows processing time
   - Answer generation includes citations

3. **Results Analysis**:
   - Neural boost values visible (+0.XX)
   - Graph connections shown (X related docs)
   - Performance metrics realistic

### ❌ **If Something's Wrong**

**No Epic 2 Features Shown**:
- Check config file selection (should use epic2.yaml)
- Verify no SemanticScorer parameter errors

**Graph Enhancement Fails**:
- Check spaCy model installation: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- Verify graph enhancement is enabled in config

**No Citations in Answers**:
- Check AnswerGenerator configuration
- Verify MockLLMAdapter vs OllamaAdapter selection

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

1. **"System not initialized"**:
   - Click "Initialize Epic 2 System" on Overview page
   - Wait for initialization to complete

2. **"SemanticScorer parameter error"**:
   - Your fix should have resolved this
   - Check config files have correct parameters

3. **"Graph enhancement not working"**:
   - Install spaCy: `pip install spacy`
   - Download model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

### Configuration Check
```bash
# Verify your fixes are in place
grep -A 5 "confidence_scorer" config/basic.yaml
# Should show relevance_weight, grounding_weight, quality_weight

# Verify Epic 2 config
grep -A 10 "fusion:" config/epic2.yaml  
# Should show type: "graph_enhanced_rrf"
```
