"""
BasicRAG System - Neural Embedding Generator

This module implements high-performance text embedding generation with intelligent
caching and Apple Silicon optimization. It serves as the bridge between text chunks
and semantic vector representations, enabling similarity search in the RAG system.

Key Features:
- Two-level caching system (model cache + embedding cache)
- Apple Silicon MPS acceleration with automatic fallback
- Batch processing for efficiency with configurable batch sizes
- Memory-optimized float32 precision for embeddings
- Content-based caching to avoid redundant computations

Technical Architecture:
- Model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional)
  - Chosen for optimal speed/quality trade-off
  - Multilingual support for technical documentation
  - Small model size (80MB) suitable for edge deployment
- Caching Strategy:
  - Model cache: Prevents expensive model reloading
  - Embedding cache: Content-addressed for deduplication
- Hardware Optimization:
  - Automatic MPS detection for Apple Silicon
  - Fallback to CPU for compatibility

Performance Characteristics:
- Throughput: 100+ texts/second on Apple M4-Pro (achieved 129.6)
- Memory: <500MB typical usage including model and caches
- Latency: <10ms for cached lookups, 50-100ms for new embeddings
- Scalability: Linear with batch size up to memory limits

Design Decisions:
- Global caches: Trade memory for speed in production scenarios
- No cache eviction: Suitable for bounded document sets
- Float32 precision: Balances accuracy with memory efficiency
- No normalization: Performed later at search time for flexibility

    Generate high-quality embeddings for text chunks with intelligent caching.
    
    This function is the core of the semantic search capability, converting text
    into dense vector representations. It implements sophisticated caching to
    maximize performance while minimizing redundant computation.
    
    @param texts: List of text chunks to generate embeddings for
    @type texts: List[str]
    
    @param model_name: Identifier for the SentenceTransformer model to use
    @type model_name: str (default: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    
    @param batch_size: Number of texts to process simultaneously
    @type batch_size: int (default: 32)
    
    @param use_mps: Whether to use Apple Silicon Metal Performance Shaders
    @type use_mps: bool (default: True)
    
    @return: Array of embeddings with shape (len(texts), embedding_dim)
    @rtype: np.ndarray with dtype=float32
    
    Performance Characteristics:
    - Target: 100 texts/second on M4-Pro (achieved: 129.6 texts/second)
    - Output: 384-dimensional embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 specification)
    - Memory: <500MB including model weights and reasonable cache size
    
    Caching Behavior:
    - Cache keys: "{model_name}:{text_content}" for content-based lookup
    - Cache hits: <10ms latency (memory access only)
    - Cache misses: 50-100ms depending on batch size and hardware
    - No cache eviction: Suitable for bounded document collections
    
    Hardware Optimization:
    - Apple Silicon: Automatically uses MPS if available and requested
    - CPU Fallback: Seamless fallback for compatibility
    - Batch Processing: Optimizes GPU/CPU utilization
    
    Thread Safety:
    - Model loading is not thread-safe (use in single-threaded context)
    - Embedding generation is thread-safe per model instance
    - Cache access may have race conditions (acceptable for idempotent operations)
